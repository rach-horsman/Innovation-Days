# Innovation-Days
These resources have been developed to support teachers to run an Innovation Day, which is a competition where teams of learners design, program and build solutions to a real-world problem. Innovation Days combine project-based learning with physical computing, such as the micro:bit and devices from Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

An Innovation Day is an engaging, motivating and fun day, which demonstrates to students that working in Computing can be a creative and social experience, where teamwork and resilience go hand-in-hand with putting subject knowledge into practice.
